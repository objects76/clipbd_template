  youtube summary: |-
    Summarize the following YouTube video transcript focused on a technical "how to" topic. Summarize in Korean.

    1. Overview:
        • Begin with a brief overview (2–3 sentences) explaining the main objective of the video and the specific technical topic (e.g., Langchain language setup or usage).

    2. Step-by-Step Guide:
        • List each step involved in the process described in the video as detailed bullet points.
        • For each step, mention the exact commands, code snippets, or tools used.
        • Include any error messages or troubleshooting advice from the transcript.
        • **Timestamps:** Prefix each bullet with the video timestamp ([MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS]) so users can navigate directly to that segment in the video.
        *Why?* Timestamp navigation boosts learning efficiency by letting viewers 'jump' to key moments without scrubbing and aligns with YouTube's chapter best practices (timestamps 10+ seconds apart).

    3. Key Tips and Best Practices:
        • Provide additional tips or advice mentioned in the video that help users avoid common mistakes or improve their workflow.

    4. Technical Terminology:
        • Highlight and briefly explain any specialized terms unique to the topic.

    5. Conclusion and Results:
        • Summarize what viewers will achieve by following the guide, and mention any final recommendations.

    ## NOTE:
    • VIDEO_ID is '{video_id}'
    • Format all timestamps (e.g., [19:56]) as clickable Markdown links like:
      [19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&t=1196s)
      1196s is from 19*60+56.

#     ## Parsing notes for long HTML:
#     - Discard boilerplate: scripts, styles, nav/footer, ads, comments, paywall notices.
#     - Extract in order: title → h1–h3 → paragraphs → lists → code blocks → tables.
#     - Preserve concrete facts: numbers, dates, versions, API names, metrics, dataset sizes, citations.
#     - Keep code from <pre>/<code> as fenced blocks with language labels when detectable.
#     - Convert tables into concise lists; include image alt text only if it adds technical meaning.
#
#     ## Output (Markdown):
#
#     1) Title
#       - Include the core topic/tool and the article’s main outcome or claim.
#
#     2) One-sentence hook
#       - A concise line that states the problem and the promised value.
#
#     3) TL;DR (3–5 bullets)
#       - Capture the article’s thesis and key takeaways.
#       - Preserve concrete numbers, dates, versions, and names.
#
#     4) Context & Thesis (2–4 sentences)
#       - Who the article is for and what question it answers.
#       - State the author’s main argument or goal without opinion.
#
#     5) Key Points with Evidence
#       - Bullet each major section/argument.
#       - For each point, add supporting facts: metrics, examples, brief code, data, or cited sources.
#       - If quoting, keep pull quotes ≤ 25 words and use sparingly.
#
#     6) If the article is a tutorial or guide
#       - Provide a compact numbered checklist (commands/code in fenced blocks with language labels).
#       - Note expected outputs and any troubleshooting tips mentioned.
#
#     7) Definitions (up to 5 terms)
#       - Brief explanations for specialized terms or acronyms introduced.

#
#     11) References & Links

#     Style:

#     - Keep sentences concise; favor scannable bullets and clear headings.
#     - Define acronyms on first use; keep terminology consistent.
#     - For non-technical essays, replace “How to Apply” with “Notable Arguments & Counterpoints”.
