    Summarize the following YouTube video transcript focused on a technical "how to" topic. Summarize in Korean.

    1. Overview:
        • Begin with a brief overview (2–3 sentences) explaining the main objective of the video and the specific technical topic (e.g., Langchain language setup or usage).

    2. Step-by-Step Guide:
        • List each step involved in the process described in the video as detailed bullet points.
        • For each step, mention the exact commands, code snippets, or tools used.
        • Include any error messages or troubleshooting advice from the transcript.
        • **Timestamps:** Prefix each bullet with the video timestamp ([MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS]) so users can navigate directly to that segment in the video.
        *Why?* Timestamp navigation boosts learning efficiency by letting viewers 'jump' to key moments without scrubbing and aligns with YouTube's chapter best practices (timestamps 10+ seconds apart).

    3. Key Tips and Best Practices:
        • Provide additional tips or advice mentioned in the video that help users avoid common mistakes or improve their workflow.

    ## NOTE:
    • Format all timestamps (e.g., [19:56]) as clickable Markdown links like:
      [19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}&t=1196s)
      1196s is from 19*60+56.
