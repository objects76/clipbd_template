Tables collapse into a mess of random words, formulas turn into weird symbols, and text decides it wants to be read from bottom-right to top-left.</p><p>That’s exactly the headache Dolphin fixes.</p><p>Dolphin is this neat, open-source framework built by ByteDance (yep, the TikTok folks) that takes PDFs and converts them into Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, or JSON, basically clean, structured formats that AI models love.</p><p>If you’re working on anything that involves feeding a model some documents, this is worth having in your toolbox.</p><figure>Press enter or click to view image in full size<figcaption>Image by — bytedance</figcaption></figure><h1>Why PDFs Are So Painful to Parse</h1><p>Most people think of PDFs as just “digital paper,” but under the hood, they’re… weird. They store text, images, and shapes in layers, without any real understanding of paragraphs, tables, or reading order. That’s why you sometimes get a sentence that reads like:</p><pre>word1  word3   word</pre><p>Messy.</p><p>Dolphin handles this with a two-stage approach:</p><ol><li>Stage 1 — Analyze the page: Figure out the structure — where’s the text, which bit is a table, what’s a formula, etc.</li><li>Stage 2 — Parse each piece: Extract each chunk in a way that makes sense (tables stay tables, formulas stay formulas).</li></ol><h1>Getting Dolphin Running</h1><p>If you’ve got Python installed, here’s the quick version:</p><pre>git clone https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin.gitcd Dolphinpip install -r requirements.txt</pre><p>Now you need a model. You can either:</p><ul><li>Download the original config-based one from Baidu Yun / Google Drive and drop it in <code>./checkpoints</code>.</li><li>Or grab the Hugging Face model (my preferred way):</li></ul><pre>git lfs installgit clone https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Dolphin ./hf_model</pre><p>Here’s how you’d turn a PDF page into structured Markdown and JSON with the Hugging Face model:</p><pre>python demo_page_hf.py \  --model_path ./hf_model \  --input_path ./demo/page_imgs/page_6.pdf \  --save_dir ./results</pre><p>When you open the results, you’ll see text in the correct order, tables as tables, and formulas actually readable.</p><h1>Parsing Only a Table or Formula</h1><p>Sometimes you don’t want the whole page — just a table, for example:</p><pre>python demo_element.py \  --config ./config/Dolphin.yaml \  --input_path ./demo/element_imgs/table_1.jpeg \  --element_type table</pre><p>It works the same way for <code>formula</code> or <code>text</code>.</p><p>For me, Dolphin is perfect when:</p><ul><li>I’m preparing datasets for AI training.</li><li>I want to summarize academic papers without losing structure.</li><li>I need to pull tables from invoices for business automation.</li></ul><p>The speed is a bonus — Dolphin supports parallel parsing, so it can chew through multiple documents faster than you’d expect.</p><p>If you’ve been burned by bad PDF conversions (I have… many times), Dolphin feels like finding that one friend who actually reads instructions before assembling IKEA furniture. It just works.</p><p>You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin">GitHub</a> or Hugging Face.</p><p>You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin">GitHub</a> or Hugging Face, and honestly, the setup takes less time than making coffee.</p></section></article>
